/**
 * Reorders the edges of the directed graph represented as an adjacency list in connections such that each vertex
 * is connected and has a path to the first vertex marked with 0. n represents the number of vertices.
 * Complexity:
 * n is the number of vertices/nodes
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 *    O(n) to initialize the adjacency list
 *    The dfs function visits each node once, which takes O(n) time in total. Because we have undirected edges,
 *    each edge can only be iterated twice (by nodes at the end), resulting in O(e) operations total while
 *    visiting all nodes, where e is the number of edges. Because the given graph is a tree, there are nâˆ’1
 *    undirected edges, so O(n+e)=O(n).
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 *    Building the adjacency list takes O(n) space.
 *    The recursion call stack used by dfs can have no more than n elements in the worst-case scenario.
 *     It would take up O(n) space in that case.
 * 
 * @param {number} n number of vertices or in this case, number of cities
 * @param {number[][]} connections adjacency matrix for a directed graph or in this case, representation of cities
 * @returns the minimum number of edges to re-arrange to ensure that each vertex is directly or indirectly connected to
// the initial vertex
