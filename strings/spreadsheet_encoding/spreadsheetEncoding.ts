/**
 * spreadsheetEncodeColumn encodes a Spreadsheet column ID as an integer and returns it.
 * Here the encoding uses the alphabets A, B, C, etc. and
 * further uses the indexing of the alphabet starting from 1 like: A=1, B=2, C=3,..., Z=26
 * Complexity
 * Where n represents the number of characters in the column_id
 * - Time O(n) as we iterate over each character in the column ID to calculate the encoding
 * - Space O(1) no extra space is required to perform the encoding
 * @param {string} columnId Column ID to encode
 * @returns {number} encoded column ID as an integer
