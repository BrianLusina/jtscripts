# Anagram Detection

Write a function that accepts two parameters, a parent and a child string.
Determine how many times the child string - or an anagram of the child string - appears in the parent string.
There is a solution which can be done in near instant time.

```js
f('AdnBndAndBdaBn', 'dAn') // 4 ("Adn", "ndA", "dAn", "And")
f('AbrAcadAbRa', 'cAda') // 2
```

An anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word (see wikipedia).

Note: anagrams are case insensitive

Complete the function to return true if the two arguments given are anagrams of each other; return false otherwise.

Examples
"foefet" is an anagram of "toffee"

"Buckethead" is an anagram of "DeathCubeK"
