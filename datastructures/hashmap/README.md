# HashMap Design

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the HashMap class:

HashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.
void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
int get(int key) returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
void remove(key) removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.

Constraints and assumptions
For collision resolution, can we use chaining?
Yes
Do we have to worry about load factors?
No
Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?
Assume they're valid
Can we assume this fits memory?
Yes
